  description: Castaways will have to roll a ball up a ramp and into a plinko board.
    While the ball is rolling down the plinko board, they must solve a puzzle, while
    keeping an eye on the ball. When the ball is close to the end of the plinko board,
    the castaways must grab the ball and roll it back up to the top. If a castaway
    misses catching the ball, they must wait for the ball to roll down to the end
    of a chute before they can roll the ball back up the ramp and return to solving
    their puzzle. The first castaway to complete the puzzle wins.
