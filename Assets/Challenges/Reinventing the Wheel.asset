  description: Both teams will race to assemble four puzzle wheels and attach them
    to a cart, in which two of their tribemates will ride. Pushing the cart through
    a series of obstacles to a finish platform, the tribes will then disassemble
    the puzzle wheels and use them to complete a turnstile. Finally, they will wind
    the turnstile to raise a fire wok, igniting their tribal cauldron. The first
    tribe to finish wins the challenge.
