  description: Under a time limit, tribe members dive into a mud pit and cover their
    body with as much mud as they can. They then race back and scrape it off into
    a bucket. They may only transport mud on their torso, and are not allowed to
    carry it with their arms or hands. The buckets are then weighed, and the castaway
    with the heaviest bucket wins.
