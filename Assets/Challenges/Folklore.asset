  description: The host begins the challenge by telling the castaways a story about
    local folklore. When the story is ended, the castaways run to stations where
    they will be asked a question about the story they just heard. Answering the
    question correctly would allow the contestant to collect an item, while giving
    an incorrect answer would force the castaway to complete a task (typically discarding
    a pointless item) before they are able to return to the station and answer the
    question correctly. The first person to get back to the starting point with all
    their items would win.
