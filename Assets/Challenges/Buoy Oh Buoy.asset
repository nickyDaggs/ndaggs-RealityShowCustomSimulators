  description: Each tribe will divide up into three pairs. One pair at a time will
    go out into the water, dive down and untie knots from a floating gate. Inside
    each gate is a fish trap with puzzle pieces. Once the tribe gathers their fish
    trap, they must take the puzzle pieces inside and use them to solve a vertical
    puzzle. The first tribe to solve their puzzle will win immunity.
