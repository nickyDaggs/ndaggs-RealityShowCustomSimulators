  description: One or two castaways will be suspended above the water, while their
    tribemates will hold a rope to keep them above the water. At certain points,
    one castaway from each tribe will let go of their rope, making it harder to keep
    up the suspended castaway. The tribe that is able to keep their suspended castaway
    up the longest wins.
