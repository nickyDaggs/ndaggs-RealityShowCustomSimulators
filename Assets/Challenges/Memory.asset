  description: Scattered in a challenge arena are numerous pairs of matching objects
    or symbols hidden under covers. One at a time, contestants will enter the field
    and uncover two items. If they match, they (or their tribe) score a point. If
    the items do not match, they are re-covered and the next contestant takes their
    turn. The first tribe/contestant to score a designated number of points, or the
    tribe/contestant with the most points when all covers have been unveiled wins
    the challenge.
