  description: One castaway from each tribe would be strapped into a wooden spherical
    cage and would guide two of their blindfolded tribemates in rolling the cage
    through a course. At the end of the course would be a labyrinth-like table maze.
    The castaway inside the cage would then have to guide two or four blindfolded
    tribe members in solving the table maze. The first tribe to finish the table
    maze would win.
