  description: Divided into teams, castaways will start on a platform in the water,
    then swim out to a raft and work together to use a rope to pull themselves and
    the raft to another platform. From that platform, they climb up a ladder, retrieve
    a key, and then slide down a pole into the water. They must then race the key
    to shore. Once a team has all their keys, they will unlock a cage to retrieve
    a set of colored blocks. The team will then use the blocks to solve the puzzle
    from Sea Crates. The first team to finish wins.
