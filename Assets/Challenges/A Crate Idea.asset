  description: Two castaways from each tribe race out to a giant tribe-colored crate.
    Once they reach the crate, they must roll it back to their tribe's mat. Upon
    reaching the tribe mat, the next pair run out to get the next crate. Once all
    6 crates have been collected, the contestants would stack the crates, solving
    a puzzle on the side of the crates (spelling out a key word or phrase). Once
    all the crates have been stacked correctly, the castaways would climb up the
    crates to a platform. The first tribe to get all tribe members on the platform
    wins.
