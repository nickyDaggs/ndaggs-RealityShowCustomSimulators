  description: Members from each tribe would race across a series of wooden A-frames
    carrying three coils of rope. At the end of the course, a few members would use
    the rope to pull a heavy wooden crate across a ramp and up to the finish platform.
    The remaining tribe members would then disassemble the crate and use the puzzle
    pieces to solve a puzzle. The first tribe to solve their puzzle would win.
