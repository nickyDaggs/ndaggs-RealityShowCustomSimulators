  description: Using centrifugal force, castaways must keep a ball spinning within
    a wheel as they stand on individual balance beams. At regular intervals, the
    castaways will be made to step forward onto narrower parts of the beam. If at
    any point the ball drops or they fall off their beam, the castaway loses the
    challenge. The last castaway standing wins.
