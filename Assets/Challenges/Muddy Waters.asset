  description: The contestants are divided into equal teams. One at a time, they
    race through an obstacle course. They crawl under a low cage (or walk across
    a series of balance beams), clamber up a steep slope and slide down into a mud
    pit. They then search for a bag of balls buried in a designated mud pit. Upon
    retrieving the bag of balls, the contestant crawls under a wooden bar by digging
    through a pit of rice. Upon reaching the mat, the next teammate may begin the
    course. Once all teammates have reached the end, the balls must be thrown into
    a narrow tube about as high as a basketball hoop. The first team to sink all
    their balls into the tube wins the challenge.
