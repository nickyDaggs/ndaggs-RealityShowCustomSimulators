  description: Castaways must race up a series of steps to the top of a tower and
    retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces/a key. Once retrieved, they would race down a
    large slide to the bottom of the tower and place their bag/key at their puzzle
    station, and head back for the next one. Once all the bags/keys were collected,
    they would use them to build a vertical puzzle. The first person to finish the
    puzzle wins.
