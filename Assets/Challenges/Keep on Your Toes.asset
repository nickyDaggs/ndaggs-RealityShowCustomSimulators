  description: Castaways would each stand on a small wooden perch in a rectangular
    frame, adjusted to their height. Standing on their toes, they would brace a wooden
    block on their head and keep it in place using the wooden board above them. If
    they fall off the frame, drop their block, or touch either the structure or their
    block, they would be out of the challenge. The last person left standing wins.
