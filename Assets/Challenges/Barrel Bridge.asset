  description: Using four barrels, two wooden planks, and 10 feet (3.0 m) of rope,
    teams would attempt to make their way from a starting line (at one end of the
    beach) to the finish line (at the other end of the beach) without touching the
    ground. If any team member steps onto the ground, the entire team would have
    to restart the challenge from the starting line. The first team to have all its
    members cross the finish line would win.
