  description: Three castaways per tribe would sit and hold onto a pole for as long
    as they can. Two members from the same gender would pull a member from the rival
    tribe and same gender off the pole to a mat. Once they get the person to touch
    the mat in any way possible then the next two castaways go. The first tribe to
    get all the castaways to touch the mat wins the challenge.
