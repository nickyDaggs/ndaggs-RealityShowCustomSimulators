  description: The tribes must run up and over two sand mounds, assemble a puzzle
    boat, using unique braces to hold it together, row out to a cauldron, light a
    torch, row back, remove the braces, and take them to the starting line. Two players
    will use 16 puzzle pieces to assemble blocks representing compass directions,
    then the tribe fits the blocks and braces into a climbing wall and climbs up
    to light a fire bale. The first tribe to do so would win.
