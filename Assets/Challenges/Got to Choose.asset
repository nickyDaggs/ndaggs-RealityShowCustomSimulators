  description: The castaways must race through obstacles to reach a puzzle table.
    However, along the way the tribes are given the choice to take shortcuts to get
    to the finish faster. The more shortcuts a tribe takes, the more puzzle pieces
    that they will have to negotiate for their final puzzle. The first tribe to get
    through their obstacles and solve the puzzle wins.
