  description: Castaways must stand on an angled balance beam while balancing a ball.
    At predetermined intervals, they would move further down to a narrower part of
    the beam, making it harder to keep steady. If they drop their ball or fall off
    their beam, they would be out of the challenge. The last person standing wins.
