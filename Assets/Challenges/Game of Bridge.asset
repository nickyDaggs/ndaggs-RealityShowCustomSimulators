  description: Castaways must race to remove planks from a crate and use them as
    part of a bridge. Each plank is individual and will only fit in one spot. Once
    the bridge is complete, the castaways would tag out and remove the planks from
    the bridge, saving the ones with part of a puzzle on them. They would then collect
    the puzzle planks and solve a puzzle. The first person to finish wins.
