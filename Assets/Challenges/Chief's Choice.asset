  description: The castaways would brace themselves with their arms between two walls
    while standing barefoot on two foot pegs. Every 15 minutes, the castaways would
    move down to smaller foot pegs. When the castaways reached the third set of foot
    pegs, they would try to remain on them as long as they could. The last castaway
    to remain on their pegs would win.
