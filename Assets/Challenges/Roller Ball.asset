  description: The castaways must stand on a small log while balancing a ball on
    a wooden disc. At regular intervals, more balls will be added onto the plate
    until there are three balls, which will increase difficulty. If at any time a
    ball falls off the disc or a castaway loses their footing on the log, they will
    be eliminated. The last castaway standing wins.
