  description: The members of each tribe line up on a very narrow balance beam. One
    tribe member at a time, they must move across the beam and around the other tribe
    members. The person crossing can only touch one member at a time. If two people
    touch at once or a member falls into the water, they must start all over. Once
    a member reaches the platform, the next person may proceed. The tribe who gets
    all their members across first wins.
