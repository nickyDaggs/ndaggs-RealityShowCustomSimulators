  description: The castaways are divided into heats. In the first round, contestants
    race across a pontoon and dive into the water. Using a rope suspended beneath
    the platform, they pull themselves, underwater, to the other end. Upon climbing
    back onto the platform they must jump back in the water and do it again. The
    first two contestants to complete two laps move on to the final heat. In the
    final heat, the castaway had to do five laps and upon surfacing, they must transfer
    a medallion from one side of the platform to another, one key at a time. The
    first person to transfer all their five keys to the other side of the platform
    wins immunity. The challenge may use rings instead of keys.
