  description: While standing or kneeling on a suspended platform, the contestants
    will hold on to (a percentage of) their body weight, as borne by ropes or a ring.
    When they can no longer hold on, the platform will give way, and they will plunge
    into a pool beneath them. The last person left holding on wins.
