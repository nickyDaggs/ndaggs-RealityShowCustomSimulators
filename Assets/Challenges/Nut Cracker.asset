  description: The castaways would play a variation of Tee-ball with the men competing
    against the men and the women against the women. The playing field would be divided
    into sections with different point values. Each castaway would take one swing
    at the ball. Wherever the ball comes to a stop, without going out of bounds,
    would be that castaway's score. There is also an overhead net that awards 10
    points to whomever lands their ball inside. The person with the highest score
    wins.
