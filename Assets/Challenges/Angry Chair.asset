  description: One person from each tribe or team will race through a series of obstacles
    to a chair. The rest of the tribe or team will then lift the chair, allowing
    that person to retrieve 10 numbered bags. Once they have collected the 10 bags,
    the next person will go, retrieving the next 10 bags, and so on. Once all 30
    bags have been collected, the tribe or team must use the 30 letter tiles to solve
    a word puzzle. The first tribe or team to complete this wins.
