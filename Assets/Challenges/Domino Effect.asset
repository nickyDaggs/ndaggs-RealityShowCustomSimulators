  description: Castaways must stack all of their blocks like a line of domino tiles
    on an angular beam while avoiding tripwires that would topple the blocks that
    were already stacked. Once all of the blocks have been properly stacked in such
    a way that they were evenly spaced to topple like dominoes that would reach the
    end of the beam, the castaway would start a chain reaction which would trigger
    a mechanism that will release a ball rolling to a bowl, releasing a flag/breaking
    a tile. The first castaway to raise their flag/break their tile would win.
