  description: The castaways must hold on to a rope attached to an unbalanced table
    to keep the table level. They must stack a wooden block on the table and hold
    on to the rope to keep the block upright. They must then retrieve one of nine
    wooden blocks from three stations while keeping all the blocks on the table upright.
    Once the block is retrieved, the castaway would have to stack the block on the
    table and retrieve the other blocks. Should any of the blocks fall, the castaway
    would have to return to the table and re-stack the blocks before retrieving any
    more blocks.
