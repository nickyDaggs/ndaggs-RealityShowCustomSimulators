  description: Each tribe will have one member sitting on a spinning platform. Another
    member will run out to the platform, grab a rope, and pull the rope back to the
    start, which will cause the platform to spin. Once the puller has made it back
    to the start, the castaway on the platform will then run through a series of
    obstacles to try and get back to the beginning. The first castaway to make it
    back to the beginning of the course will score a point for their tribe. The first
    tribe to three points will win reward.
