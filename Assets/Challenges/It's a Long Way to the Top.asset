  description: Pairs of tribe members will make their way up a four-story tower.
    On each of the floors, the pairs will throw crates down the tower, breaking them
    to release sandbags or coconuts, which will be collected as ammunition. Once
    all four sets of crates have been thrown down, one pair will collect the ammunition
    and the tribe will throw them at targets. The first tribe to hit all their targets
    wins.
