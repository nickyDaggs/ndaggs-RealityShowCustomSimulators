  description: The teams would begin by unspooling ribbons from a pole to release
    a key. Once they have the key, they would build a ladder. One person would climb
    to the top of the ladder and use that key to release a bag of balls. They would
    then make their way through a net sling to the finish, where they would attempt
    to land those balls in a series of targets by stomping to release them. The first
    team to get one ball in each of the five targets wins.
