  description: Each tribe selects a given number of people to shoot balls from a
    slingshot into an open field. The remaining contestants spread out to designated
    locations and compete to catch the balls with either wicker baskets, a handheld
    net, or their bare hands. Every time a ball is caught (including balls fired
    by the opposing tribe) that tribe scores a point, and the first tribe to reach
    a given score wins the challenge.
