  description: All castaways are stationed at a fire scale. Each structure is a seesaw
    with two buckets. One end has a bucket for building a fire, while the other has
    a bucket filled with water but with a hole at its base. The castaways first start
    a fire in the fire bucket. Then, once the flame is sustainable, the castaways
    fill the water bucket with water from a nearby river or ocean. When there is
    enough water, the weight of it lifts the fire bucket up to reach a fuse. The
    first castaway to light their fuse, igniting a fire at the top of the scale,
    wins the challenge.
