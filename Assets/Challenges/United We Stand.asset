  description: 'Played in shallow water, each tribe uses a platform attached to a
    long pole (sometimes assembled in-challenge as a puzzle component) to transfer
    members of their tribe from one high platform to another. Once these teammates
    have reached the final platform, all members of the tribe must climb up to a
    smaller platform and fit onto the tower with their feet above the highest deck
    to win the challenge.  '
