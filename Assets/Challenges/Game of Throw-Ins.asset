  description: Each tribe will divide into pairs and be tethered together. One pair
    from each tribe will maneuver through the obstacles inside the game field to
    retrieve their tribe-colored ball. They will then attempt to shoot it into a
    basket. If they miss, the ball will bounce away from the shooters, forcing them
    to chase after the ball. The first tribe to score a set number of points wins.
