  description: Facing off one against one in a fenced off circle, a castaway from
    each tribe would hold a wooden idol on top of a platform that they would hold
    in one hand. They would use the other free hand to attempt to knock their opponent's
    idol off the platform. The castaway whose idol hit the ground last would score
    one point for their tribe.
