  description: Castaway must retrieve sea water with a bucket and throw to a tribemate.
    The final tribe member must catch the water itself in another bucket, and use
    it to fill a jar. The tribes must repeat this until they have enough weight in
    their jar to lower it to the ground, sending a lit flame up to a fire tower,
    or allowing them to move on to the next section of the challenge.
