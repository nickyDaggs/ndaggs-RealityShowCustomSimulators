  description: 'The castaways are divided into two teams of five. One at a time,
    each castaway will cross three obstacles: a ramp, a net obstacle, and a balance
    beam. Once all five members have completed the course, they will dive into the
    water for a grappling hook, which they will use to secure five rings. The first
    team to grab all their rings wins.'
