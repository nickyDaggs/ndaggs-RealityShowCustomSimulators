  description: One player runs to a boat, grabs a bag of rice, then comes back, throwing
    the bag to the second person, who throws it to the third, who throws it to the
    fourth, who throws it to the final player, who dumps it in the marked bin. Then,
    the same thing happens with a bag of beans, and again with six large fish. Before
    each fish is placed in their bin, the final player must chop off the heads and
    tails with a cleaver. The first tribe to get everything in the right bins wins.
