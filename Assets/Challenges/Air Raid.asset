  description: One at a time, members of each tribe must race up a tower and through
    a series of obstacles. Once they have made it to the top of the tower, they will
    each take turns launching sandbags with a giant slingshot, attempting to hit
    targets out in a field. After a target is hit, tribes are required to switch
    out members, with each member being required to hit at least one target. The
    first tribe to hit all targets would win.
