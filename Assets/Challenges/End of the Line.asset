  description: Castaways must sprint along a trail of ropes and find a series of
    checkpoints. Along the way, they will encounter junctions where, in order to
    proceed, they must place another carabiner on the other part of the rope then
    unclip the first. Castaways must cling on to the carabiner at all times. At each
    checkpoint, there are several ropes that lead to the next checkpoint as well
    as there several ropes that lead to dead ends. If a castaway encounters a dead
    end, they must backtrack to their last checkpoint and start over. The first person
    to reach the end of the trail wins.
