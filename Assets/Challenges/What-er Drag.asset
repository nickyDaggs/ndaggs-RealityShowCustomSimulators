  description: Castaways must race across a floating bridge to the end of the course
    while pulling a rope being woven out by a wench. When they reach the end of the
    course, they would grab either a bag of puzzle strips or clip themselves onto
    a puzzle piece. The tribe will then pull that person back by cranking the winch
    (in Philippines the castaways did not use either a floating bridge or a winch).
    Once all the puzzle pieces are back, tribe members will solve the puzzle.
