  description: 'Rock Bottom is a Survivor version of the game "Bring Me", where for
    the first three rounds, contestants would dive under water to find a shell and
    bring it back. The last contestant to do so would be eliminated. For the fourth
    and final round, the four remaining contestants would dive into the water, grab
    a rock and swim back to shore with it. The first contestant with the rock wins.  '
