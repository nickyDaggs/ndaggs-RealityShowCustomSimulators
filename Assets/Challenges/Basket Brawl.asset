  description: Playing in a field of shallow water, three castaways (an equal number
    of men and women from each tribe) would battle for control over a ball. Once
    a contestant has acquired the ball, they must throw it into their tribe's respective
    net, which would score them one point. Every time a point is scored, tribes may
    swap members in and out of the challenge depending on the stipulation for the
    upcoming round. The first tribe to score three points would win the challenge.
