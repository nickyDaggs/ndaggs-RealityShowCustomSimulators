  description: While harnessed together, the two competing tribes will circle around
    an oval course (either in shallow water or on land) while carrying a twenty-pound
    backpack each (or similar heavy load). Players can drop out of the challenge
    at will, but they must give their weight to a tribemate before unclipping themselves
    from the rope. The first tribe to catch the opponent and touch one of their members
    wins.
