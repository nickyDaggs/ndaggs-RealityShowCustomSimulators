  description: Starting from a platform in the ocean, one member of each tribe will
    swim to a buoy marker, dive down and untie knots, releasing more buoys. Tribe
    members would then corral the buoys to shore and place them on a rack before
    shooting the buoys into a basket. The first tribe (or tribes) to shoot ten buoys
    into the basket wins.
