  description: Castaways must stack letter blocks on a wobbly platform to spell out
    designated words. When returning to their station to collect more blocks, they
    must first lock in their mechanism. If any blocks fall, they must lock in their
    mechanism before picking up the fallen blocks, return them to their station,
    and start over. The first castaway to correctly spell the designated words without
    any upside-down letters and lock in their mechanism wins.
