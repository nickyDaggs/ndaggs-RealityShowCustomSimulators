  description: Prior to the challenge, the tribe will divide themselves into pairs.
    At the challenge, the pair will crawl through a twisted rope tunnel, one at a
    time. They will then race to dig up planks from a sandpit, with the last few
    pairs to do so being eliminated. The remaining pairs will climb to a tower and
    use their planks to cross a rope bridge; the first two pairs to get across with
    all their planks will advance to the final stage. The final four contestants
    will then compete individually in an endurance challenge, with the last person
    standing being declared the overall winner.
