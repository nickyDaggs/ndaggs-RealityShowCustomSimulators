  description: Castaways must roll a series of balls down a lane on a wooden board
    to the end where there are several slots for the balls to land in. The first
    person or tribe to land all their balls in slots at the same time wins. In the
    tribal version of this challenge, each tribe must first make their way through
    a course before reaching the final table maze. Two members then maneuver the
    balls down the board and land them in all the slots.
