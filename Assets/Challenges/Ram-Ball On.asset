  description: Castaways must race to balance a ball on the top of a pole while maneuvering
    through a series of obstacles. Along the way, they would add another section
    of the pole, making it harder to balance the ball as they make their way through
    the course. After they got past the balance beam, they would have to untie knots
    to get to a table, where they would place the ball on it to retrieve a key, then
    using the key to unlock a chest of sandbags and shoot the sandbags at a series
    of bamboo targets. The first castaway to finish wins.
