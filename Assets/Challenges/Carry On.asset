  description: Each tribe will have one member attached to a heavy bag of coconuts.
    The rest of their tribe will help their tethered tribemate navigate through a
    series of obstacles by carrying their bag of coconuts. On the way to the finish,
    that tribemate must retrieve a set of rings on a balance beam. Once all four
    rings are collected, one other castaway will throw the rings and land them on
    a post.
