  description: Each contestant is blindfolded, and must make their way through a
    maze whilst accomplishing given tasks (typically collecting medallions). Throughout
    the maze, raised signposts with Braille insignias help to point the castaways
    in the direction of items or the end of the maze. The first contestant to accomplish
    all the required tasks and reach the end of the maze wins the challenge.
