  description: The tribes will race down a ramp and go through an obstacle course
    where they will make their way to a large wooden crate, which contains a ladder.
    They may choose to open the crate by unlocking it with keys or untying its knots.
    Once they have freed their ladder, they must maneuver their ladder through a
    series of obstacles. Thereafter, one member will climb the ladder to assist in
    a final task; the first tribe to complete the course wins.
