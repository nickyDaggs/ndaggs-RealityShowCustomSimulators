  description: Keeping one hand on the Tribal Immunity Idol at all times, contestants
    would have to keep their balance while standing on a small log. If at any point
    a contestant takes their hand off the Idol, falls off the log, or raises their
    foot, they would be eliminated from the challenge. The final player left holding
    onto the Idol would win.
